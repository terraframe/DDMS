Subject: Re: Localisation of MDSS

 

Hi Miguel,

There are three types of localization involved:

1) MOJO exceptions/messages

2) MDSS exceptions/messages

3) Universal/Class metadata values





MOJO exceptions/messages:

The attachment "serverExceptions.properties" lists all of the MOJO native exceptions.  These messages are presented to the end user whenever a constraint is violated that MOJO enforces out of the box.  To localize these messages into Portuguese, copy this file and rename it to "serverExceptions_pt.properties".  Translate each line.  The "#" is a comment character and lines that begin with it are treated as comments.

Here is an example:

# Thrown when a user tries to create an object without permission
# {0} toString for the entity that was being created
CreatePermissionException=You do not have permission to create [{0}].

Translate the text: 
  "You do not have permission to create" 

The "{0}" character represent a variable placeholder for a value that will be supplied at runtime.  This is how it would look to the end user when he or she tried to create something without adequate permissions:

  "You do not have permission to create [Mosquito Collection]" 

OR

  "You do not have permission to create [Sentinal Site]" 


DO NOT EDIT OR MODIFY THE NUMBERS SURROUNDED BY BRACES.  These are variables.   Rather, you move these variables to the place in the sentence where it would be grammatically correct.

For example, you could reword the message as follows:

    You cannot create a [{0}] because you do not have adequate permissions.

Which would produce:

    "You cannot create a [Mosquito Collection] because you do not have adequate permissions."




MDSS exceptions/messages

Each MDSS exception message is defined in its own XML file.  All languages for that message are defined in the same file.  Attached is an XML file for an exception that is thrown in MDSS  To translate this message into Portugues, modify this file.  Copy the line: 

<locale language="en">The Property [{id}] failed to validate.  Valid values are: [{validValues}]</locale>

and paste a copy right below it.  Change the value 

<locale language="en">

to 

<locale language="pr">

and translate the text.  Anything between braces "{}" is a also a variable.  Do not modify these variables.  Rather, copy them and move them to the place in the sentence where it would produce a grammatically correct result.




Universal/Class metadata values

These are the human readable display labels for universals and attributes.  I think the easiest thing would be for us to provide you with a list of all universal names and their fields used in MDSS. Once the values were translated, we would then modify the domain model definition (written in our XML syntax) and add the Portuguese version of all of the metadata display labels.


Let me know if you have questions.


-Nathan

Hi Nathan, Now that SYS01-2 (CRUD on localisable fields) has been completed, it's timeto start planning for the first partial translation of the system.  Have youthought of a way to get these fields in and out of the system?  What isinvolved here and in what format can we expect your export? Regards,Miguel.
