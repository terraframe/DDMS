MDSS Zambia Download
By S.Coetzer

1	-	Download parts 1 to 5 into the same folder
2 	-	Rigth click on the first part file "part1" and select "extract files" using your file extractor
3	-  	This is a "one step extraction" so you don't need to extract the other files.
4	-	 Use the extracted file to uplload or restore your database








Please Note:
The file size is to big to upload from the MRC, so I had to break up the file into easy uploadable files.
