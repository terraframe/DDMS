# DDMS

The DDMS is a Windows-based entomology and vector-borne disease data collection, management, and reporting platform.

This DDMS repository is divided into many different sub-projects. The DDMS project is the core DDMS webapp, the rest are supporting projects.

The latest user manual can be found here:

It does not include any documentation about the Kaleidoscope, which is our recommended way to do mapping and reporting. That, and also documentation on using the DHIS2 import/export functionality can be found here:
